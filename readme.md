# Generic Game Download Cache Docker Container

# Important Note
This container is designed to cache a single game cdn in a single instance. In most use cases you will want to use the [steamcache/monolithic](https://hub.docker.com/r/steamcache/monolithic) image instead. If you really know what you are doing and wish to use generic please read the usage on [github](https://github.com/steamcache/generic/blob/master/USAGE.md)
